div {
  font-size: clamp(16px, 3vw, 32px);

see MDN:

    clamp() allows you to set a font-size that grows with the size of the viewport, but doesn't go below a minimum font-size or above a maximum font-size. It has the same effect as the code in Fluid Typography but in one line, and without the use of media queries.
